The Twisted Bilayer Graphene Simulation (TBG Sim) is a web-based application designed to model and visualize the unique properties of twisted bilayer graphene systems.
This tool provides an interactive platform for exploring the electronic band structure and moirÃ© patterns that emerge from varying twist angles and strain conditions.

The tools is build using [React 19](https://react.dev/) as the framework, [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) for high-performance graphics rendering and [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as the UI component library as well as [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for creating and diagonalizing the Hamiltonians.

The Bandstructure model is based on a modified Bistritzerâ€“MacDonald Hamiltonian from the paper ["Unusual magnetotransport in twisted bilayer graphene from strain-induced open Fermi surfaces"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307151120), I greatly recommend reading it for a deeper understanding of the physics involved.

The Website is hosted on [bilayer.graphene.science](https://bilayer.graphene.science).
